[ The definition of fantasy on the silver screen ](/review/rw7352708/)

[martinpersson97](/user/ur45812214/)17 September 2021

Warning: Spoilers

Tolkien's Middle-Earth mythos has captured readers for many decades, and
whilst a movie adaptation was inevitable, few dared to take it on.  
  
Enter Peter Jackson in 2001, a director most known for low-budget horror films
and contemporary dramas - not one you would associate with an adventure movie
on an epic scale, but you could not be more wrong.  
  
This movie, along with its sequels, stands as one of the greatest achievements
in movie making of all time. Everything is perfect, the acting, the pacing and
tone, the action scenes and of course, the visuals. It's without a doubt some
of the best effect works ever seen.  
  
With an appropiate running time of 3 hours, or 4 if you watch the Extended
Cut, it feels very true to the novel and on the same grand scale. The world-
building is like nothing ever seen before and is very much the template for
every fantasy world ever put on screen since.  
  
As mentioned above, the actors all do an amazing job, and make you feel for
these characters, as little as they are in this grand world. There are a lot
of funny and human interactions, that just adds even more to the sense that
this is a real world - something Tolkien intended to allude to.  
  
Along with its two sequels and three prequels, this acts as the fourth chapter
in an epic saga about the struggle against evil, that should best be
experienced as a whole.

[ #1 movie of ALL time ](/review/rw7351161/)

[justthenaughtystuff-44694](/user/ur132078642/)16 September 2021

Blah blah blah don't wanna hear about your Godfather, Citizen Kane, etc. While
good there is a reason this always places 1st in yearly polls. As for the 1
star ratings that's some hilarious s..t. Seems about the IQ level of the
reviewer. If you were bored that is on you.

[ Brilliant start to a mind-blowing trilogy! ](/review/rw7350885/)

[mattfie-05453](/user/ur124413792/)16 September 2021

Warning: Spoilers

I watched this movie dozens of times. The Fellowship is absolutely brilliant
with stunning locations, amazing characters, music is epic and the plot is fun
to watch.  
  
An absolutely magnificent way to start the trilogy! If you haven't seen this
movie and you are a massive fantasy fan, you will enjoy it. You won't be
disappointed.  
  
I immediately fell in love with the characters including Frodo and Sam, two
brave hobbits, Merry and Pippin the funny troublemakers, including my
favourite line We had one yes what about second breakfast? Then there is
Aragorn known as Strider early in the movie who is incredibly brave followed
by Legolas and Gimli.  
  
The LOTR trilogy is not only the greatest fantasy of all time, but it is one
of the greatest movies of all time!

[ Epic in its duration ](/review/rw7316298/)

[drz](/user/ur0688704/)7 September 2021

Nicely filmed and eventful but I got bored on both occasions I watched it: two
decade apart.  
  
This is basically some eye candy for the fans of the book.  
  
The events and characters are not played out deeply enough for one to care.
There are way too many things happening that are superficially depicted,
barely make sense, or display reverence to unexplained places or events - all
that keeps the viewer unengaged. The dialogue is childish, the emotions are
slow-motion molasses, the fight scenes overdramatized, the movie is long. Very
long. And the end is not the end: you gotta watch another workday's worth of
time to get there.

[ The Journey Begins ](/review/rw7310177/)

[kaczorowskibartlomiej](/user/ur113146249/)5 September 2021

Plot: On his uncle Bilbo's 111th birthday, Frodo Baggins receives a mysterious
ring. He soon discovers that it was created by the Dark Lord Sauron to control
the other rings and take over Middle-Earth, and that the ring must be
destroyed in the fires of Mordor where it was created. Thus begins Frodo's
journey, but even with a company of nine, taking the ring to Mordor will not
be an easy task. I'll start off by saying that this movie looks absolutely
gorgeous, especially The Shire and Rivendell. Another great aspect is that the
music is fantastic, whether it is the calm music in The Shire or action packed
in Moria. The casting is perfect and the all of the actors do a great job with
their roles, especially Ian McKellen as Gandalf. The characters are memorable
in their own ways, like Sam, the loyal and brave friend of Frodo or Gandalf,
the wise old wizard. And while it did cut out some portions of the book, it
still is very faithfull to the book both as an adaptation and in spirit. A
great start to a fantastic trilogy.

[ Top Shelf film ](/review/rw7303708/)

[stevenschoenfelder](/user/ur37268519/)3 September 2021

I'm rating this based off of the Extended version. It still holds after 20
years. The visual effects are still cool. And even though it doesn't follow
the novel 100%, it does it's own thing quite well while still following the
core story. I consider it a Masterpiece.

[ This movie should be top 4 ](/review/rw7281126/)

[jtprint](/user/ur92935580/)28 August 2021

Yes, this movie should be in the top 4, I don't know where, but it should and
should be at least 9.1 / 10. The movie is a masterpiece. Excellent story,
soundtrack, cinematography, set design and a pretty good CGI to be from the
early 2000's, from start to finish this movie hooks you, for those who like
fantasy, of course.  
  
A film that will have passed 50 years and will still be on the lips of
cinephiles.

[ O inicio da aventura ](/review/rw7257313/)

[eagandersongil](/user/ur68044468/)22 August 2021

Peter jackson is one of the best directors in terms of good budget use, the
director probably learned that in his early career directing great trahs
movies, and in "The Lord of the Rings" it's no different, peter makes a film
of almost 4 hours grand, with impeccable costumes and makeup, great visual
effects for the time and a wide range of magnificent backdrops and screen
compositions, by comparison, the same year also came out Harry Potter and the
Sorcerer's Stone which cost 38 million more, although "The Lord of the Rings"
seems much more expensive.  
  
I didn't read the classic JRR Tolkien book to know how it was transposed to
the screen, but even with a long film time, we have zero waste, we have a
story that constantly grows, full of arcs and a past that transports
mythology, all of this combined with a classic and very well constructed hero
arc that unfolds in a great intro drama, the film has four acts and a short
last act that already leaves a plot for the sequel.  
  
The entire art direction of the film is exquisite, the feature film, which is
already over 20 years old, leaves some special effects dated, it's true, but
at the time it was very surprising and still convinces today, especially in
its costumes and makeup, which are still great today. , photography and the
use of the green background still work reasonably well, and the soundtrack is
a show on its own, showing the inner emotion of each nucleus through its
melodies.  
  
Peter Jackson works well not only the visual and script factor, but also works
the small layers, such as obsession, fear and overcoming, and also knew how to
squeeze the most out of his cast of actors, taking magnificent performances,
such as de Ian McKellen for example.  
  
The film is very well worked in its most diverse layers, every shot is very
well executed and formidable, the weakest point perhaps is the lack of
coherence, violence and the sobriety tone of the work, which changes its state
of mind constantly, but these are details that do not bother this work at all,
which amuses, entertains and enchants to this day. GRADE 8.5/10.

[ Better ](/review/rw7255365/)

[lthayn](/user/ur135693141/)21 August 2021

It was better than the books left a lot of clutter out of story but many still
over depressing at times but after trade towers a light in the dark also.
Brotherhood as a real Idea instead of cheap talk.

[ Camera shots used in the film you selected ](/review/rw7237731/)

[miraythatqueen](/user/ur133006406/)17 August 2021

Warning: Spoilers

The Black rider & the hobbits shot - The cinematography and the composition of
the shot where the Black rider appears from behind the big tree gave the
effect of a sudden eerie silence that settles in that scene. The purpose of
this shot was to reveal the looming presence over the defenseless hobbits as
the filmmaker's camera slowly tilted upwards.  
  
The Ring's Words on the Frodo's face shot - The close up shot in the scene
where we see the ring's fiery words aglow on Frodo's face is an entirely
digital version of the Ring for those shots reflected onto the innocent face
of Elijah Wood's Frodo. The effect was storytelling in images as it was a
silent shot. The purpose of this camera shot was to confirm that Bilbo's old
ring is indeed the One Ring.  
  
The Demise Of Gollum shot - Poor Gollum! He got the Ring back in his grasp in
this shot, and as the shot widened we saw him towering over into oblivion.
Maybe it wasn't Gollum, maybe it was Smeagol, we'll never know! He never got
the chance to slip it on his finger. The effect of this shot was to show the
first moment of triumph from his bizarre elated face, shot through the circle
of the Ring. The purpose of the shot was something beautifully ironic about
how Gollum brought about his own destruction along with the ring during his
moment of triumph. The CGI was not the best, but the scene and the shot at
Mount Doom showed that there was hope and it was providence that destroyed the
ring.

[ Lord of the Rings Sucks ](/review/rw7234687/)

[gmule-30812](/user/ur130025779/)16 August 2021

The movie proceeds as if you've read the voluminous Tolkien book. If you
haven't, total confusion sets in.  
  
It was one of the most convoluted, disjointed, meaningless movie I've seen. No
introduction of characters, no continuity of scenes nothing...  
  
The movie begins in a cave, with characters you don't know, the flashing to
the desert, jumps to a castle, a troll appears and calls everyone "my
precious". Now, that's probably the only thing that made sense.  
  
I gave it about an hour, then went to another movie next theater over. It
deserves a 0.

[ Best fantasy movie ever. ](/review/rw7202113/)

[burhanerdemir-drcael](/user/ur122363546/)6 August 2021

It is one of the few productions that can still be watched after 20 years. It
is a cult production not only in the fantasy genre but also in the movie
world. The extended version definitely deserves a 9.5/10 rating. Watch it,
show it. It is a project that today's modern fantasy productions should take a
lesson from. Besides the million-dollar productions boosted by CGI, this movie
is a treasure.

of any preexisting story that has ever been adapted to film. Whether you enjoy
the content is irrelevant in the context of this achievement.

[ The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring ](/review/rw7164921/)

[MrFilmAndTelevisionShow](/user/ur123158576/)26 July 2021

There can be little doubt that the Lord of the Rings film are the greatest
trilogy of all time. At the time of writing the films sit on the top 250 at
7th, 10th, and 14th. No other trilogy is so highly rated. The Godfather Part
III is nowhere to be seen on the Top 250.  
  
Peter Jackson + Howard Shore + The the amazing actors (every single one was
absolutely brilliant, from Elijah Wood to Marton Csokas. Not to mention all
the stunt doubles, special effects team, editors all all others who made this
film/these films what they are. And a special thanks to the country of New
Zealand for being so very beautiful!  
  
This is my favourite film of all time, no doubt about it, there are no
criticisms that I believe are valid!

In 2021, the UHD, HDR version still looks as amazing as ever. Such a great
entry to my all time favourite trilogy. The lore and the story run so deep
that even after all 6 films if you include the hobbit, it still leaves you
wanting more.

[matthewcohen-82259](/user/ur134695927/)17 July 2021

There are movies I love as much as Fellowship, but there are very few things I
love more than it. The whole trilogy is great, but almost nothing out there is
as breathtaking as the first of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy.
Returning to it as an adult, it really is shocking how incredible this is from
start to finish. Despite its length I maintain, to this day, that it is never
boring and constantly arresting. Achingly beautiful, occasionally funny, the
definition of epic, Fellowship of the Ring has it all. Oh, and that
soundtrack? Need I say more? 10/10, a timeless masterpiece.

[SHU_Movies](/user/ur86310970/)15 July 2021

This movie probably hasn't aged the greatest with some super noticeable green
/ blue screen, very early 2000s acting and VFX and some super blurry camera
shots, but it's an absolute icon that you've got to look at in perspective of
the time. This is a textbook example of how to make a fun fantasy / horror
movie that directors should all take notes from!

[ Beautiful Film ](/review/rw7353070/)

[frenchy-64339](/user/ur137220342/)17 September 2021

Warning: Spoilers

This movie touches so many hearts. It is a beautiful film about life. There is
everything in this movie, including romance, friendship, comedy, hardship, and
personal growth. Forrest Gump almost has several lives. I love that many
people can either relate to or appreciate the movie. I find the ending very
heartwarming; Forrest Gump sending his son off on the school bus shows that he
is starting a new life full of experiences just as his father did.

[ Tom Hanks' best movie ](/review/rw7345409/)

[emmabernard-00965](/user/ur136965947/)14 September 2021

I saw this movie many times and each time it teaches you more about the power
of love and innocence It takes us through decades of his life by going to
Vietnam's war and doing everything following his heart.  
  
I've always loved the fact that the film highlight a simple person's life
who's always in troubles yet never really understands it. It is a mix of
unconsciousness and sensibility by to find the one he loves.  
  
Share it to the rest of the people !

[ 27 years later and still a classic ](/review/rw7344260/)

[gagecleasby](/user/ur114152469/)14 September 2021

This movie was released 9 years before I was even born and I finally got
around to watching it and it's way better than any movie I've seen recently.
Tom hanks is 100% on the mount Rushmore of actors. This movie will be a
classic for a long while.

[ Best movie of all time ](/review/rw7341367/)

[bellrat](/user/ur22105698/)13 September 2021

This movie is quite simply the best movie of all time.  
  
The negative reviews talk about how dumb the movie is and how it's message is
that you just stroll through life and succeed by doing as your told are
missing the true beauty of this movie.  
  
The story is unreal, it's crazy. It's not normal for people to have all that
success and experience. But that's the appeal, having a character who doesn't
care about any of that, doesn't understand it. He's not cocky like most people
would be who achieve what he achieves. What he really wants is that love,
which always seems to cruelly evade him. But he carries on and never changes
who he is.  
  
What I always loved about the movie was the adventure. The highs and the lows.
It has so many beautiful moments. I love how the people involved wouldn't let
budget constraints ruin the movie and persisted to make this fil lm what it
should be and refused to cut vital scenes.  
  
The movie isn't realistic. It's an escape. For a short period of time, you can
escape and enjoy Forrest's adventure.  
  
Enjoy the ride.

[ Brilliant Movie Forrest Gump ](/review/rw7339462/)

[ReaDay](/user/ur26555778/)13 September 2021

Warning: Spoilers

When I first watched this movie I was blown away, the 2nd time I was blown
away and the 3rd the 4th the 5th etc etc. Tom Hanks lost weight and put on
weight to look the part for his movies. He's truly a magnificent actor
certainly one of the best in my time. I have rarely seen a movie that Tom is
in that wasnt very good. My son and I always narrate parts of the movie when
we feel the need to act silly and saying "You got new legs Lieutenant Dan ! Or
"Sorry I ruined your New Years eve party Lieutenant Dan but she tasted like
cigarettes!" My son is now 29 and we still mess around now and then. It is
truly one of the movies that everyone speaks about and a wonderful feel good
90's movie as most of the movies in the 90's were. I recommend this movie for
everyone 15 and up as it is funny, entertaining, factual and just a feel good
type of movie that you will want to watch at any time any era for the many
eras to come, and it gets etched into your mind making you want more. Shame
there wasn't a follow up though, maybe one day.

[ A Tom Hanks outstanding performance ](/review/rw7286446/)

[CrazyArty](/user/ur134224713/)29 August 2021

The legendary Tom Hanks epic, this movie is part of cinema history and must be
seen.  
  
Hanks plays a slow (dim-witted) but decent individual and this movie charts
his life and his place in the events of the US history of the time. From
meeting Elvis to President Nixon, to fighting in Vietnam and starting his own
business.  
  
It's probably a little too long but is touching and heartfelt, and the plot is
interesting. Hanks delivers an outstanding performance earning a well-deserved
place in Hollywood royalty.  
  
An epic film with an epic lead performance.

[manaskrishnasingh-60544](/user/ur126389290/)29 August 2021

I don't know what they want to show, the character is lost, the story is.  
  
Really they called it a good movie. Though actors did a great job.  
  
But the story is totally lost, nonsense. After all the torture, i thought it
will be inspired by a real story, then I got to know that it was not.

I enjoyed the movie. It have a great love story and its trought all big events
happened in America. They have some clever visual effect made and some great
integration in some old video of the white house and the meeting with Kennedy.
I found it very well made and made the whole thivg very believable. I enjoyed
this movie. I recommend it.

people all round the globe. There's a reason this is amongst the best of the
best films ever made.

[ The special effects are what is memorable about this movie
](/review/rw7256747/)

[steiner-sam](/user/ur42508869/)21 August 2021

It's set from the 1950s to the 1980s in the United States and Vietnam and is
loosely based on the 1986 novel by Winston Groom. It follows the life
experiences of a man with an IQ of 75 who seems to be on the edges of many
major events.  
  
As a child, Forrest Gump (Michael Conner Humphreys/Tom Hanks) has a curved
spine and is put into leg braces as a corrective. Unfortunately, his low IQ
and braces make him the target of abuse by other children except for the girl
that becomes his only friend and life-long love interest, Jenny Curran (Hanna
Hall/Robin Wright). Forrest's mother (Sally Field) runs a boarding house and
is endlessly supportive of Forrest.  
  
When young Forrest sheds his braces while running away from tormenters, he
learns he can run very fast. This ends up getting him a football scholarship
and a college degree. He then is drafted and ends up in Vietnam, where his
best friend is an African American, Bubba Blue (Mykelti Williamson). He also
greatly admires Lieutenant Dan Taylor (Gary Sinise). Bubba sells Forrest on
shrimp fishing as a career, and they agree to work together after the war.
However, Bubba is killed, and Lieutenant Dan is seriously wounded.
Nevertheless, Forrest wins a medal for heroically saving several of his
comrades.  
  
Meanwhile, Jenny, who was sexually abused by her father, has gone completely
counter-culture. She and Forrest intersect from time to time, but she always
disappears back into her world as Forrest keeps brushing greatness as he
marches through his life.  
  
What can one say about this unique movie? First, it makes great use of special
effects, leading to hilarious scenes like Forrest tipping off the authorities
about the Watergate break-in or Forrest showing Lyndon Johnson on national TV
the injury to his buttocks that earned Forrest a Purple Heart. Indeed the
special effects are what is memorable about the movie. Without them, the movie
would never have made the impact it did.  
  
The love story between Forrest and Jenny is melancholy but feelgood in its own
way. The relationship between Forrest and Lieutenant Dan is fairly
predictable. The humor sprinkled throughout enhances the experience.

[SPZMaxinema](/user/ur132395489/)21 August 2021

Tom Hanks gives the once in a lifetime performance as Forrest Gump, who no one
could've played any better. This is a true American story with funny moments,
sad moments, and everything in between. I've loved this movie since high
school and will never stop loving it.

[ Must watch for movie lovers!! ](/review/rw7254637/)

[papanloveu](/user/ur134833304/)21 August 2021

Warning: Spoilers

The story of forest instills a dilemma,can ALL these happen in just one short
life? Being born with a low iq and disability in the legs,as kid Forrest runs
to flee from his naughty classmates chasing him, braces in his legs fall apart
and he feels like running with air. Growing up,he joins the US army fighting
in Vietnam war,initiates shrimp business returning from the battlefield to
keep words of his loving friend. And at a time,goes for a world tour on foot
bearing the pain of separation. But this apparent unbelievable story
introduces some amazing dreams in our eyes and bewitching feelings in our
brain,which outgrow its unlikelihood. We fancy believing this improbable
story,because Forrest's apparent 'idiocy','madness'and simpleness resemble
something outstanding. Forrest seems personality-less since throughout the
movie he complies to other's direction,whereas deep inside it projects a
profound experiment of belief on humanity. In addition to it's appealing
story,unique storytelling and powerful acting,'Forrest Gump' holds a bunch of
strong,inspiring dialogues.  
  
Tom Hanks Favorite!

[manusankar_e](/user/ur135045681/)21 August 2021

Into the Heart The way innocence and compassion wins over anyone who comes
across forrest gump is too overwhelming and what the cinema left behind to us
was love, respect and compassion. Hat's off Tom Hanks, One of the best
performances ever happened, and brilliance of the whole crew. The first thing
which came to my mind after finishing the movie was whether Tom Hanks got the
academy award or not..and he does.... Watch it mates atleast once in your Life
:-)

Warning: Spoilers

I wonder why people are giving this movie bad ratings. It gave me an idea
about how crazy life is and how big it is. The emotional scenes were very sad
and made me cry. Truly an amazing story. And maybe Forrest Gump is not so
smart, but he had good friends along his journey and inspired a lot of people
:)
